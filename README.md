Text based game about being a prisoner in a space prison with a lot of adult themes. Working title is Broken Dreams Correctional Center or BDCC for short

This game is influenced a lot by other erotic text rpg games like Trials in the Tainted Space and Lilith's Throne. The idea of a scifi space prison setting came from the second life sim called RRDC

Heavy wip

Uses Godot 3.4.2 engine

So far these things are done:
- Scene framework that supports any number of nested scenes, replacing scenes, scenes returning result. Basically everything will be a scene
- World scene which allows to traverse the rooms and interact with them
- Simple combat system + fighting scene
- Characters
- A simple yet very powerful saving/loading system that allows to save the game state at any point in any scene
