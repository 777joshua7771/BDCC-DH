		saynn("[say=captain]I understand why you are upset, I truly do. But this is my final decision.[/say]")

		saynn("[say=alexrynard]This just doesn't make any sense. This can lift so much pressure off of our current staff. Guards, nurses, engineers.. even chiefs. Any kind of hard manual labor can be automated with ease. Androids are the future, how can you not understand?[/say]")

		saynn("[say=alexrynard]Sure, they will break a lot at first. But with enough time they will become extremely reliable. They don't need food or sleep. Only power and occasional repair.[/say]")

		saynn("[say=alexrynard]But then why? Why all of this? Why create an entire robotics lab? Why scan brains? Why make prototypes?[/say]")
